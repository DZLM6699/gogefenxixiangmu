Use Godot editor version 3.6.0 (steam version) to edit the project.
GodotSteam can be found here: https://github.com/CoaguCo-Industries/GodotSteam/releases 
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
